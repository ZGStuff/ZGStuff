- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ZGStuff
I make stuff
my most recent thing is a piece of malware
known as 32Delete.
It is composed of one command prompt script.
It deletes the Users, System32, SysWOW64, and WinSxS folders in Windows.
It's a PC killer!
It is UNTESTED, so please wait before testing yourself.
It is also unfinished.
wait this stuff belongs in the real 32Delete repository!
bye :)
